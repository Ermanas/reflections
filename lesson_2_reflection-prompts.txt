What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    It gives us an opportunity to choose which files that we want to track.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
        The statging area is like a preview of our next commit. So we can check it
    and decide that should we keep it or we can make some adjustments.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
        Branches are useful when we want to create an experimental changes
    without working our original project files. We create a branch for it
    and make our changes on this. At the same time we can continue to develop
    our master branch. If the features that we've been developing on our
    new branch so we can merge the master and the new branch. If it would not
    work, so we can simply delete this branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
        Diagrams helped me to understand better the branch structure on git.
    It gives you the understanding like a tree topology. Thanks for it!

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
        git merge gathered all the changes and merged it with using recursive
    merging strategy.  

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
