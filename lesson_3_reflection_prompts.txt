When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
    We can clone any repository from the github and we can modify it, we can add
    new commits on it. If we want to make our own version of a project, we can
    for the repo to our repository on our profile on github. Then we can do
    whatever we want without effecting the original repository. Also people can
    see the originial version on its owner's profile.
    We use branches when we want do a significant changes. If we want to add a
    new feature to our project or if we want to do experimens on our code, so we
    can create a new branch and if we can succeed, we'll be able to merge it
    to the master branch.
